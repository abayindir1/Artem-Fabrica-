## Overview

This is a full stack MERN application that I practiced my React skills and learned Redux. Artem-Farbrica is a website that users can draw using canvas and share with others.

Also, users can comment on other drawings made by different people, like them and download to their computers in png format if they wish. 

Check out this project deployed to heroku [here](https://artem-fabrica.herokuapp.com/)

## Challenges

This is my first React App with Redux. I struggled setting up Redux and using it. This application was hard but I enjoyed every bit of it. It also took longer for me to finish because of my schedule. 

I also had problems when I tried to deploy to heroku, but handled it with the help of Google.
